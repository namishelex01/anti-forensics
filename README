bogspls
- make truecrypt volume less random to help avoid detection

derpherp
- script to checksum certain bytes on a device and verify checksum against a flat file from future checks
*note*: be sure to update $devicelist to your flat file

didsomeonesayspidermanthread
- simple script that edits privoxy config inline to either enable or disable browsing through tor via privoxy

durrhurr
- script to pollute device (via filesystem) with artifacts of encrypted files, all dynamically generated. carving device will produce over 9000 encypted files with long passwords and garbage content, obliterating signal:noise ratio.
*note*: point $wordlist at a dictionary file or whatever

goobypls.patch

helloyesthisisdog.py
- helloyesthisisdog is a python script for embedding and  extracting parasite files into a host png file. several  options are available to protect your parasite file from detection or carving. when embedding a parasite file, the resulting file is named as 'infected.png' unless -o is used.
the parasite file can first be 'encoded' with an xor using the -x option and specifying a key in hex representation. your parasite file can also be split across two sections in the png so that carving tools will not extract a single, contiguous version of your parasite file. use -e for this.

herpderp
- script to checksum certain bytes on a device and write checksum to a flat file for future checks
*note*: be sure to update $devicelist to your flat file

hurrdurr
- encrypts files with random passwords then removes the encrypted files

isdolan.patch

lookatallthefeelsiknow
- store system time, change system time to random time reset file time, restore system time

opwilldeliver
- generate an encrypted but crackable archive that contains a fake keepass database with no actual info in it

picsoritdidnthappen
- script that generates and encrypts/compresses random files then stores encrypted file in image and audio files using steghide. file is encrypted with long, random, password; but embedded into host file protected by dictionary word. easy to extract, hard to crack, all for nothing (random)
# *note*: point $wordlist at a dictionary file or whatever

scalpel.conf

shoopwhoop
- writes fun bytes to a device

umadbro
- generate an encrypted but crackable archive that contains a fake truecrypt volume with no actual info in it
